# Blender Cursor Trail Addon

## Overview

This addon adds a trail effect to the mouse cursor in the 3D viewport to help with visibility.

### Features

- **Customizable Trail Width and Length**: Adjust how thick and long the trail is.
- **Dynamic Trail Colors**: Set separate start and end colors for the effect.
- **Jitter Effect**: This is completely pointless, but kinda neat.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef4fdbe4-f197-4b40-a4e4-14bf1bb8279b

### Features

- **Customizable Trail Width and Length**: Adjust how thick and long the trail is.
- **Dynamic Trail Colors**: Set separate start and end colors for the effect.
- **Jitter Effect**: This is completely pointless, but kinda neat.

### How to install addons:

### Known issues
- Seems to only do around 100 points even when length is maxed out.
- May effect color when trail is visible under the cursor when picking.
